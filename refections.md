In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

Command line is a way to administer the operating enviroment as well as the file and folder infrastructure. It is similar to the GUI file explorer but can enable us to execute commands much quicker due to the keyboard buffer and tab completion. The command line can also enable piping of commands as well as scripting and automation.

Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
I stuck to the timeline because as a former systems administrator I am quite familiar with the Windows command line features which are similar to bash.

Name 5 commands you used and what they do
ls - list files and folders inside directory
touch - create a file
cd - change directory

Did you learn anything unexpected?
This was my first opportunity using bash and I learned a few nuances of the bash shell.
